Here is some text that is hidden and waiting for later. And now it appears!

## What do we want to do?  
<br/>

::: {.fragment .strike}
Leverage high-throughput or high-performance computing solutions to run stock assessment models
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Run more/bigger models in less time
:::

## How can we do this? 
<br/>  

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
###### High-throughput computing (HTC)
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
###### High-performance computing (HPC)
:::
:::

## Why use HTC/HPC computing? 
<br/>  

-   Efficiency

-   Reproducibility

-   Documentation

-   Transparency

-   Automation [?]{.fragment .fade-in}

## Workflow  

::: incremental
1.  create container
2.  create scripts
3.  transfer files
4.  submit jobs
5.  transfer files back to local machine
