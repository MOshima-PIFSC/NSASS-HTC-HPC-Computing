## Connecting to Hera via ssh

Open a terminal window (.e.g, command prompt or PowerShell), then open an ssh tunnel to Hera by using the following command:

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
ssh -m hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com User.Name@hera-rsa.bastion.rdhpcs.noaa.gov -p22
```

Replace `User.Name` with your NOAA HPC account name, and `bastion` with either `boulder` or `princeton` depending on which 'bastion' you wish to log-in through. Note that the flag `-p22` specifies opening port 22 and is optional. 
When prompted, put in your password followed by the [RSA authentication code](https://docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/accounts/rsa_token.html): 
```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
XXXXXXXXRSACODE
```


If you see the following then you have connected successfully:

```{bash} 
#| echo: true
#| output: false

```
Note that you will also see the following terminal output upon connecting:
```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
Local port XXXXX forwarded to remote host.
Remote port YYYYY forwarded to local host.
```
Where `XXXXX` and `YYYYY` are your 4-5 digit port forwarding numbers. Make note of what your local port number (`XXXXX`) is since this will be used for scp file transfer using an ssh tunnel.

## Transferring files to/from Hera 

### via scp using data transfer node (DTN)

Information in this section is largely based on [this wiki](https://docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/data/index.html)(CAC login required). File transfer using a DTN is only possible from machines within the noaa.gov domain (VPN ok), and can only transfer files to the *scratch* directory. However, this is ok since it is recommended that input/output data files are stored in the *scratch* directory. Using a DTN is faster than using the [ssh tunnel](#transferring-files-tofrom-hera-via-scp-using-an-ssh-tunnel).

::: {.callout-note}
# Note
The `scratch1/NMFS/project_name/` directory is a shared space (shared access and shared disk space) for all users of a project. Rather than dumping files into the *root* project directory (e.g., `project_name/`) it is better to place them in your own sub-directory. Since this sub-directory structure does not already exist you will need to log into Hera and create it:

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
mkdir scratch1/NMFS/project_name/User.Name/
```
This will avoid over-writing other users' work.
:::

File transfer takes place via *scp* using:
```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
scp /path/to/local/file User.Name@dtn-hera.fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov:/scratch1/NMFS/project_name/User.Name/
```
and replace `User.Name` and `project_name` with your HPC account name and project.

If trying to transfer from a machine not within the NOAA domain (or on the VPN) you can use *scp* with an *untrusted* DTN:
```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
scp /path/to/local/file User.Name@udtn-hera.fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov:/scratch1/data_untrusted/User.Name/
```
Note that `dtn-hera` was changed to `udtn-hera`. As before replace `User.Name` with your HPC account name. Since files can not stay in the `data_untrusted` directory we will need to [log in to Hera](#connecting-to-hera-via-ssh) and move it to the correct project directory on scratch. Once logged in, moving the files can be done with [*rsync*](https://docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/data/local_migration.html) (CAC login required), and then they can be deleted from `data_untrusted` by:
```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
rsync -axv /scratch1/data_untrusted/User.Name/file /scratch1/NMFS/project_name/User.Name/
rm /scratch1/data_untrusted/User.Name/file
```
Be sure to replace `User.Name` and `project_name` with your HPC account name and project.

Files can be downloaded using *scp* from either the trusted (`dtn`) or untrusted (`udtn`) DTN:
```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
scp User.Name@dtn-hera.fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov:/scratch1/NMFS/project_name/User.Name/file /path/to/local/file 
```

### via scp using an ssh tunnel

Information in this section is largely based on [this wiki](https://docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/data/transferring_data.html) (CAC login required). File transfer using an ssh tunnel is possible from all locations. Using the ssh tunnel for file transfer requires a two-step process with two active terminal windows (we suggest using PowerShell):

1. In the first terminal window, open an ssh connection to Hera with port forwarding:
```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
ssh -m hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com -LXXXXX:localhost:XXXXX User.Name@hera-rsa.bastion.rdhpcs.noaa.gov
```
Replace `XXXXX` with your local port number. As before replace `User.Name` and `bastion`.

2. In the second terminal window you can check to see if the tunnel was properly created:
```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
ssh -p XXXXX User.Name@localhost
```
if you get prompted for your password then success! Press `CONTROL+C` to ignore this prompt. Staying within this 2nd terminal window use *scp* to transfer your file:
```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
scp -P XXXXX /path/to/local/file User.Name@localhost:/home/User.Name/
```
This will copy your file from your local machine into your home directory on Hera. Simply append additional directory structure to `/home/User.Name/` to copy it into a sub-directory that you have created on Hera (e.g., `/home/User.Name/sub/dir/`). To transfer files into your *scratch* directory, specify the proper destination path (e.g., `/scratch1/NMFS/project_name/User.Name/` where `project_name` is your HPC account project). 

To download a file from Hera using *scp* and the ssh tunnel use the following:

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
scp -P XXXXX User.Name@localhost:/home/User.Name/file_name /path/to/local/file 
```
